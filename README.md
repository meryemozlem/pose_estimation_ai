REAL-TIME BODY POSE ESTIMATION   A PROGRAM THAT DETECTS WITH THE SUPPORT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND  DESIGN

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Purpose of the Project   
Program and design project that detects real-time body pose estimation with artificial intelligence support 
in many fields of computer vision, such as human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence and sports. 
is an applicable research topic. The main objective of the project is health monitoring with Artificial Intelligence  
real-time estimation of 3D human body poses for use in applications 
and calculates that the movements are made at the right angle and provides the user with a program that 
about posture. It helps users to maintain the correct body position while practicing sports. 
to improve their experience by supporting them to protect themselves, enhance their sports performance and 
providing AI-powered proctoring to make their workouts more efficient is key 
is one of the objectives. In line with this objective, the real-time data received at the beginning of the project 
body poses are detected from the images and this information is analyzed by a deep learning based model. 
with the help of deep learning and machine learning algorithms. Using Deep learning and Machine learning algorithms, 
The first step, the system model, was developed for predicting body poses. This 
system model was applied to the dataset and achieved high performance. This project

aims to provide suggestions for correction and improvement. Up-to-date with continuous development 
working on the research topic and gaining different perspectives on development are also among the objectives. 
is one of them. 
1.2 Similar Examples in the World and in Turkey  
Real-time body pose estimation has been a major area of research in artificial intelligence and image processing in recent years.

covers. Research has shown that various projects developed in this field, especially artificial intelligence 
clearly demonstrates that it includes the field of assisted body pose estimation. Worldwide 
OpenPose, Google MediaPipe, Microsoft Azure Kinect platforms in similar projects 
has been used. Pose estimation has been studied in academia and R&D projects. 
Ahmet Samet HALICI and Ayşe DEMİRHAN's [1] Kalman filter and global nearest neighbor 
multi-person real-time pose tracking project with the multi-person real-time pose tracking method 
are cited as examples of such practices. Such projects are often used in the field of health, mobility 
analysis applications, the game development industry and virtual reality applications. 
are used. One of the pose analysis methods is machine learning based methods, 
Considering the studies in the literature, maximum accuracy compared to other methods 
has been observed.  
There are additional indicators and features that distinguish this project from other applications. 
A software that instantly returns the body position value and warns if the posture position is incorrect 
and all optimizations have been enhanced by making it easier for users to read the expressions.
